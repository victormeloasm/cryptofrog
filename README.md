**CryptoFrog** is a robust, secure, and user-friendly encryption application developed for Linux Ubuntu. Built with modern C++20 standards, CryptoFrog utilizes a custom elliptic curve (**ECCFrog512CK2**) alongside powerful cryptographic algorithms such as **AES-GCM-256** and **Argon2ID** for secure, reliable, and efficient file encryption and decryption. Its graphical interface is powered by **GTK3**, offering a sleek, retro-inspired hacker aesthetic.

CryptoFrog extends the concept from its predecessor project, [**OpenFrogget**](https://github.com/victormeloasm/OpenFrogget), introducing enhanced security, an improved user interface, and more efficient encryption methods.

## Features

- **Hybrid Encryption:** Combines custom elliptic curve cryptography (**ECCFrog512CK2**) with **AES-GCM-256** symmetric encryption.
- **Secure Key Derivation:** Utilizes **Argon2ID**, winner of the Password Hashing Competition, for secure key generation.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Sleek, intuitive GTK3 interface.
- **Efficient:** Optimized binary using UPX compression.
- **Retro Hacker Aesthetic:** Unique user interface inspired by classic hacking tools.

## Installation

### Dependencies

CryptoFrog requires several libraries and tools. Ensure you have the following installed:

- **C++20 Compiler** (g++)
- **GTK3 Development Libraries**
- **libsodium** (Cryptographic library)
- **GMP** (GNU Multi-Precision Arithmetic Library)
- **UPX** (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables)

Install dependencies using the provided script:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y g++ libgtk-3-dev libsodium-dev libgmp-dev upx
```

### Building from Source

Clone this repository and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptofrog.git
cd cryptofrog
```

Compile the project using Make:

```bash
make
```

Upon successful compilation, the binary will be located in the `build/` directory.

---

## Usage

Run CryptoFrog using the following command:

```bash
./build/cryptofrog
```

### Encrypting Files

1. Open CryptoFrog.
2. Select the file you wish to encrypt using the "Choose File" button.
3. Enter a strong password in the provided input field.
4. Click "Encrypt". CryptoFrog will output an encrypted file with the `.ecc` extension in the same directory.

### Decrypting Files

1. Select an encrypted file (with `.ecc` extension).
2. Enter the password used for encryption.
3. Click "Decrypt". CryptoFrog will decrypt the file, restoring the original contents.

## Technical Details

### Encryption Method

CryptoFrog uses a hybrid encryption method:

- **ECCFrog512CK2**: Custom elliptic curve cryptography for secure key exchange.
- **AES-GCM-256**: Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode for symmetric encryption.
- **Argon2ID**: Secure key derivation from user passwords.

### Custom Elliptic Curve

**ECCFrog512CK2** is a custom-developed elliptic curve designed for high security, rigorously tested to resist known vulnerabilities. This curve represents a substantial upgrade from its predecessor implemented in [OpenFrogget](https://github.com/victormeloasm/OpenFrogget).

### Compression with UPX

The final binary is compressed using **UPX**, reducing the file size significantly without compromising execution speed or security.
